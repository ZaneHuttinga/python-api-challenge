## WeatherPy folder

### WeatherPy.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file runs Python code to generate a random list of cities and then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for each. The notebook then produces several scatter splots showing trends in several weather conditions relative to latitude.

### VacationPy.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file takes the list of cities from WeatherPy.ipynb and uses the weather data found in that file to narrow down the list of cities to a short list of ideal vacation spots. It then uses the Geoapify API to find a hotel within 10 kilometers of each city's coordinates. It also produces two interactive maps, one showing the full list of cities and the other showing only the ideal vacation spots. Both maps feature drop-down lists of info, including the specified hotel in the latter case.
